# 🧠 Apply Lightweight Fine-Tuning with PEFT

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** as a practical and resource-friendly method to adapt large foundation models for specific tasks. Instead of retraining entire models, PEFT allows selective tuning of small subsets of parameters, significantly reducing computational cost while preserving performance.

You'll walk through the complete workflow of using a pre-trained transformer model for **sequence classification**, applying PEFT techniques—particularly **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**—to fine-tune the model, and evaluating the resulting performance improvements.

## 🎯 Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- ✅ Load and evaluate a pre-trained transformer model
- ✅ Apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the Hugging Face [`peft`](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) library
- ✅ Perform inference and compare performance before and after fine-tuning

---

## 🧪 Key Components

### 🔍 1. Load and Evaluate a Pre-trained Model
- Select a model suitable for sequence classification (e.g., GPT-2)
- Load a corresponding tokenizer and dataset
- Perform initial evaluation to establish baseline performance

### 🛠️ 2. Apply Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
- Choose a PEFT method (recommended: **LoRA**)
- Configure PEFT hyperparameters
- Fine-tune the model using a Hugging Face dataset
- Save the fine-tuned model

### 🧾 3. Run Inference and Evaluate
- Load the fine-tuned model
- Perform evaluation on the same task
- Compare performance with the baseline model

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **PyTorch**
- **Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets**
- **Hugging Face PEFT Library**
- Google Colab or Udacity Workspace (for limited GPU support)

## 🧩 Implementation Guidelines

### 🧠 Model Selection
- Must support sequence classification
- Use smaller models for limited environments (e.g., GPT-2)

### 🧪 Dataset
- Select a dataset from [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) suitable for **text classification**
- Ensure the dataset is small enough to run in your workspace

### ⚙️ Evaluation
- You may use Hugging Face's `Trainer` with `evaluate()` or any valid alternative
- The key is to show comparative metrics before and after fine-tuning
